*Why do so many people have trouble cooking brisket*

Cooking brisket has a reputation for being one of the most challenging tasks in the world of barbecue, and many people struggle to get it right. The difficulty begins with the cut of meat itself. Brisket comes from the chest of the cow, an area that supports a lot of weight and movement. Because of this, it is filled with dense muscle fibers, connective tissue, and collagen. These characteristics make the meat tough if not cooked properly, requiring patience and the right technique to transform it into something tender and flavorful.

The method most often used for brisket is low-and-slow cooking. This means maintaining a steady, low temperature over several hours to give the collagen time to break down into gelatin. The challenge here is twofold: keeping the cooking environment consistent for such a long period, and resisting the temptation to speed up the process. Many cooks get frustrated when the brisket “stalls,” a period where the internal temperature seems stuck around 160–170°F for hours. Without experience, people may panic, crank up the heat, or pull the brisket too early, resulting in dry or chewy meat.

Moisture management adds another layer of difficulty. Brisket has two main parts—the flat, which is lean, and the point, which has more fat. Balancing the cooking so that both parts finish properly is tricky, as the lean flat tends to dry out before the fatty point is fully rendered. To help, many pitmasters use techniques such as wrapping the brisket in foil or butcher paper, often referred to as the “Texas Crutch,” to retain moisture and push it through the stall. Even after cooking, brisket demands patience. It needs to rest, usually wrapped and held in a cooler for at least an hour, to allow the juices to redistribute. Skipping this step is another common mistake that leads to dry slices.

In short, brisket challenges people because it requires mastery of time, temperature, and patience all at once. It is not a cut of meat that forgives shortcuts. Yet, for those willing to invest the effort, the reward is extraordinary—succulent, smoky slices that showcase the art of barbecue at its finest.

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
